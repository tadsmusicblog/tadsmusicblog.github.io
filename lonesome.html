                <p>The Lonesome Crowded West is an Indie Rock album made by the band Modest Mouse in 1997. The members featured on this album are Issac Brock (Guitars, Vocals), Jeremiah Green (Drums), and Eric Judy (Bass). It received positive reviews at the time of release and is considered by many to be one of the top 100 albums of the '90s. The vocals on this album are unique compared to other albums at the time, Issac's voice is raw and intense at times while still being soothing and quiet. The lyrics touch on topics such as religious fear, materialism, and urban sprawl. The instrumentals on this album are very well done, they are simple while still being intense and emotional when needed. My favorite part about this album is the constant change in pace, during the song "Teeth Like God's Shoe Shine," Issac starts the song with an intense screaming voice, while in the middle he makes his voice calm and soothing and then at the end he goes back to the intensity found at the beginning. Personally, my favorite song is Lounge (Closing Time), Issac sounds like he is being chased throughout most of the song even during quieter parts, and the guitar mixed with the Bass and Drums is incredible. In short, this album will forever be a timeless classic that improved on what the midwest emo scene had been doing for years.</p>
