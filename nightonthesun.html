                <p>Night On The Sun is an EP by Modest Mouse and was released in 1999 as a Japan-only album, again in 2000 it was released in the US and UK as a 12" vinyl. There are six songs on this EP which makes it short but sweet. My favorite song is Night On The Sun because of the hypnotic guitar and interesting lyrics. All of these songs later became part of future modest mouse albums, for example, Dark Center Of The Universe (The Moon & Antarctica). The last track No Title is just Jeremiah Green speaking Japanese and is also the weakest part of the album.</p>
