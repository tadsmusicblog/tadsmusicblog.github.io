                <p>Twin Fantasy (Mirror To Mirror) is a solo album made by the Indie rock musician Will Toledo also known as Car Seat Headrest. According to Will Toledo Twin Fantasy is a concept album made about a relationship he was in at the time, which is apparent when you listen to the lyrics. The album covers deep topics such as depression and love in a way that is relatable to the listener even if they've never experienced some of the things Will Toledo sings about. The sound is very lo-fi which is really charming in my opinion. My favorite tracks on this album are Beach-Life-In-Death and Bodys, Beach-Life-In-Death is the longest song on the album clocking in at 12 minutes and 11 seconds. This is one of the greatest and most personal indie rock albums made in the 2010s but if you aren't a big fan of lo-fi Car Seat Headrest rerecorded it in its entirety as well as writing new lyrics, this new version called Twin Fantasy (Face To Face) is an overall improvement in sound but Mirror To Mirror will always be my favorite version for it's raw and original sound.  </p>
