                <p>The Powers That B is an Experimental/Industrial Hip Hop album made by the Sacramento based band Death Grips. The members featured on this album are Mc Ride on vocals, Zach Hill on drums, and Andy Morin handling the overall production. The album is comprised of two halves, Side A is NOTM, And Side B is Jenny death. Each half was released on a different date, NOTM was released in 2014 and Jenny Death was released in 2015. The two halves are different in some ways, side A features a calmer Mc Ride that speaks in a much softer tone of voice than on side B; Side B features an angrier Mc Ride that has screaming vocals and a general shift in mood. An example of this would be how on the first song of side B titled "I Break Mirrors With My Face In The United States" Mc Rides Mood Has shifted dramatically from the previous song titled "Big Dipper". Personally my favorite song on the album is On GP, The reason I like it is because it shows an emotional side to Mc Ride that hasn't been seen on many other songs. This album is pretty amazing but not entirely perfect, it isn't an easy listen either unless you are comfortable and used to harsher sounding music. I'd recommend this to anyone who already likes Death Grips or wants to expand their musical horizons.</p>
